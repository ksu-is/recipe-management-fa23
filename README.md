# Recipe Manager(2023)
#This practical tool will assist you in keeping track of recipes you might enjoy and any modifications you might want to make!

#We both love to cook, therefore we are  frequently look through various cookbooks and websites to discover new dishes to try. But we have trouble remembering which recipes we've tried and liked, and we also have trouble modifying them to fit our unique tastes. For this reason, we want to develop an application called a Recipe Management System that would make it simple for users to find, save, and edit recipes. Among the many features of the Recipe Manager would be a database of recipes that users could search through according to several parameters, like ingredients, cooking time, and degree of difficulty.
